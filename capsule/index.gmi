## About
Gemplex is an experimental (like all things Gemini) Search Engine for Gemini written in Go. You can find the source code here:

=> https://git.sr.ht/~elektito/gemplex Source on Sourcehut

Why another search engine? There's no grand reasoning really but here's a gemlog post I wrote about it:
